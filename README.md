411 Final Project

Trello: https://trello.com/b/uLGHgPau/saltar

UNITY VERSION: 2019.1.3f1 Personal

DOES NOT WORK ON IPHONE AT THE MOMENT. Do not own a developer license to be able to test it with. Also do not own an android device. Can be tested on the computer. It has been fully developed with being setup for mobile though.

Take into consideration I chose unity as opposed to Unreal engine. Chose Unity in order to be able to use code more and understand what I am doing as opposed to UI and unity is not as intensive on computer. That in mind, project took substantially longer due to having to code everything.


All my scripts can show features that are requested on rubric even if they are slighty bugged.

GAME INFO:
- Endless scroller where platforms are randomly generated as well as gems to collect for points. Every second alive generates more points



KNOWN BUGS:
- Platform generation can randomly stop 
- Platforms can overlap
- High Score feature was working but broke when added gem collectibles (High scores is fully programmed and implemented though)
- Gems can generate and destroy but do not appear on screen. (It is fully programmed and randomly generated)
- Restart Game button after losing doesn't work.
